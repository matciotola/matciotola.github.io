## About Me

I received the B.Sc., M.Sc. (cum laude) degrees in Automation Engineering and PhD degree in Telecommunications Engineering from the University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy, in 2018, 2020, and 2024 respectively. I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Naples Federico II. In 2020, I held a traineeship with the Centre de Coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement (CIRAD), Montpellier, France, where I conducted my research at the Maison de la Télédétection. From 2022 to 2023, I was a Visiting Scholar with the Université Bretagne Sud, Vannes, France, where I fulfilled my research with the Environment Observation With Complex Imagery (OBELIX) Research Team. I am a member of the GRIP Research Team. My main research interests focus on data fusion of remotely sensed images, particularly super-resolution and pansharpening, through deep learning algorithms.

## Research Interests

- **Remote Sensing:** multispectral pansharpening, hyperspectral pansharpening, super-resolution, feature extraction, image reconstruction
- **Machine Learning:** deep learning, convolutional neural networks, attention mechanism
- **Computer Vision:** super-resolution, image enhancement, image reconstruction, image generation
