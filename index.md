## About Me

I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Automation Engineering, earning the latter cum laude, and completed my Ph.D. in Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ITEE) in 2024 at the University of Naples Federico II, Italy. I am currently an Assistant Professor at the same university and a member of the Group of Research on Image Processing (GRIP).
In 2020, I carried out a research traineeship at the Centre de Coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement (CIRAD) in Montpellier, France, conducting my work at the Maison de la Télédétection, an interdisciplinary center dedicated to remote sensing for environmental and agricultural applications. From 2022 to 2023, I was a Visiting Scholar at the Université Bretagne Sud in Vannes, France, collaborating with the Environment Observation With Complex Imagery (OBELIX) research team.
My primary research interests focus on remote sensing image analysis, particularly multi-source image fusion, including super-resolution, pansharpening, and co-registration of multispectral, hyperspectral, and panchromatic data. My work leverages deep learning techniques to develop advanced methodologies for image processing in remote sensing.
Since 2025, I have been serving as Chair of the Young Professionals Affinity Group of the IEEE Italy Section.
