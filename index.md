## About Me

I received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees (cum laude) in Automation Engineering from the University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy, in 2018 and 2020, respectively, where I am currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree. In 2020, I held a traineeship with the Centre de Coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement (CIRAD), Montpellier, France, where I conducted my research at the Maison de la Télédétection. From 2022 to 2023, I was a Visiting Scholar with the Université Bretagne Sud, Vannes, France, where I fulfilled my research with the Environment Observation With Complex Imagery (OBELIX) Research Team. I am a member of the GRIP Research Team. My main research interests focus on data fusion of remotely sensed images, in particular super-resolution and pansharpening, through deep learning algorithms.

## Research Interests

- **Remote Sensing:** multispectral pansharpening, hyperspectral pansharpening, super-resolution, feature extraction, image reconstruction
- **Machine Learning:** deep learning, convolutional neural networks, attention mechanism
- **Computer Vision:** super-resolution, image enhancement, image reconstruction, image generation
